Plan

Build a to-do list app without a ui at first

After building the app in the command line, build the ui

We should have the following classes w/ the following properties
    - ProjectList
    - Project
        - title
        - description
        - priority
    - ToDo
        - title
        - description
        - priority


I need to make a function that checks if there
is a created projects array or not already


BIG PLAN

Use Class Syntax
Separate dom modification from logic
Use composition instead of inheritance
Use WebPack
Use Date-FNs (node module)
Use this to format and manipulate dates and times
Use local storage to save their to-do lists
Apply SOLID concepts
