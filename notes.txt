Plan

Build a to-do list app without a ui at first

After building the app in the command line, build the ui

We should have the following classes w/ the following properties
    - ProjectList
    - Project
        - title
        - description
        - priority
    - ToDo
        - title
        - description
        - priority



BIG PLAN

Use Class Syntax
Separate dom modification from logic
Use composition instead of inheritance
Use WebPack
Use Date-FNs (node module)
    Use this to format and manipulate dates and times
Use local storage to save their to-do lists
Apply SOLID concepts




Current actual steps
Finish adding functionality then do DOM
Add To-Do functionality
Project:

    functions:
        initializeProject - creates all the to-dos in localStorage
        Edit todo
        Delete todo
        Clear ToDos


Once I finish functionality:
Add steps to
renderProjectList() that remove the divs
inside of the projectList parent, and
add functionality to Project.render()
that appends them back. If the element
was already created we can reuse it,
if it doesn't have an assigned element we
can create one then append it
